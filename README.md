# About This Repository

I'm a student currently learning web development through online resources such as YouTube. I'm in 12th grade and plan to pursue a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) next year.  

This repository contains my practice code as I work on building a strong foundation in web development. It includes basic examples and experiments with:  

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

The purpose of this project is to document my learning progress and improve my understanding of how these core technologies work together to build websites.
