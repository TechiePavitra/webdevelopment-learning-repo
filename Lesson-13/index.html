        <p>CSS is a stylesheet language, CSS stands for Casacading Style Sheet, in Modern age,  HTML is  only for
            structuring Website while CSS has separate purpose for Styling, when HTML firstly came there was no option
            for styling, so in early 1990s HTML has some styling elements (tags) like &lt;font&gt; which is now replaced
            by modern css</p>
